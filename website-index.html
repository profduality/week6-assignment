<!-- <header> the <header> tag is actually a newer style html5 tag for a part of the body of the html page, but it's confusing, so I've fixed by instead using your intended opening tag for the <head> section of the page, where your stylesheet references & <title> tags will all live -->
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href=mystyles.css>
<title> Jack Robert Clonan: The First Teaching Superhero </title>
</head>
<!-- then you need to close out this head area (where the metadata lives) and open up the main content of the body of the page using the <body> opener tag - right after the closing </head> tag. See below, where I've added in the opener for <body>: -->
<body>
<!-- using the <header> semantic html5 tag to designate the part of your page content that includes your main headline, etc., is an excellent idea -->
<header>
<h1 style="text-align:center"> Jack Robert Clonan </h1>

<!-- <body> tag does not open here, it opens right after the closing of the <head> section of the document, as seen on lines #8-10, so it's commented out -->
<p style="text-align:center"> My name is Jack Robert Clonan, and I am a Technology & Engineering Education (K-12) major at Central Connecticut State University (CCSU).</p>
<!-- good use of inline style attributes on your html tags. If you would want most or all <p> elements in page to have text-align: center, you might include that style on the selector p in the exgternal stylesheet. -->
<p style="text-align:center"> During my time at Central, I have been in two leadership positions as the Treasurer of The T.E.E.C.A (Technology and Engineering Collegiate Association) Club Treasurer and Central Cares President.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"> I was also a Resident Assistant (RA) for two years; I was placed in Mid Campus Residence Hall and Beecher Hall which both led to great adminstirative experiences.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"> This past summer, my best friend Ethan and I founded Infinite Education. This company aims to use the energy of superheroes and gamified learning to ultimately change education for the better</p>
<p style="text-align:center"> Our custom "learning superheroes" named Professor Duality and Journeyman will surely get kids excited to learn again.</p>
<br>
<strong> Long-Term Project Goals: </strong>
<ol>
  <li> Write my Honor's Thesis on technology and the changing educational landscape.</li>
  <!-- don't forget to close out each <li> list item element, then also to close out the <ol> ordered list after the last of the list items.  -->
  <li> Create an immersive and entertaining phone application for kids to learn code and other skills on.</li>
  <li> Host the first ever superhero summer camp, so kids can learn how to make themselves superheroes through video.</li>
</ol>
<!-- </body> close out the body of the html page immediately before you close out the html tag -->
