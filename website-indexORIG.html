<p style="text-align:center"> My name is Jack Robert Clonan, and I am a Technology & Engineering Education (K-12) major at Central Connecticut State University (CCSU).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"> During my time at Central, I have been in two leadership positions as the Treasurer of The T.E.E.C.A (Technology and Engineering Collegiate Association) Club Treasurer and Central Cares President.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"> I was also a Resident Assistant (RA) for two years; I was placed in Mid Campus Residence Hall and Beecher Hall which both led to great adminstirative experiences.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"> This past summer, my best friend Ethan and I founded Infinite Education. This company aims to use the energy of superheroes and gamified learning to ultimately change education for the better</p>
<p style="text-align:center"> Our custom "learning superheroes" named Professor Duality and Journeyman will surely get kids excited to learn again.</p>
<br>
<strong> Long-Term Project Goals: </strong>
<ol>
  <li> Write my Honor's Thesis on technology and the changing educational landscape.
  <li> Create an immersive and entertaining phone application for kids to learn code and other skills on.
  <li> Host the first ever superhero summer camp, so kids can learn how to make themselves superheroes through video.
